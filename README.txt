This game is a (hopefully) simple avoid some objects and collect other objects.
Collect the white balls and avoid the black balls

What Works:
1) The basics of moving, collecting some balls and avoiding other balls
2) Health bars and Score Keeping


What doesn't work:
1) Refreshing the start screen to NOT be the game over screen
2) The black balls keep changing to white and vice versa but yet the original colors code still applies.
    In other words, a white ball will change to a black ball but still maintain white ball properties.
3) In Codio, an error of " GET https://agenda-voyage.codio.io/favicon.ico 403 (File doesn't exist) " keeps appearing but there is nothing wrong.
4) Slightly humorous Kaomoji do not work in Codio but do in Replit.
5) Displaying the level number


What kinda works:
1) Health replenishing is supposed to increase by 1 or 2 depending on the level but it shoots up way too far.
